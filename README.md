# diff_color_mixing

This project contains the files for my 291: Differentiable Programming final project.

This project requires Loma to be installed. View installation instructions [here](https://github.com/BachiLi/loma_public]).

To run the RGB mixer, run `python3 optimize_color.py`.

To run the Kubelka-Munk mixer, run `python3 optimize_km_mix.py`.

Note that the KM mixer crashes with segmentation faults intermittently.
